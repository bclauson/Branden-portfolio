  <h2> Welcome to my Portfolio! Here is a little information about me</h2>

  <p>My name is Branden Clauson, I am a recent graduate from the <a href="https://www.uoregon.edu/">University of Oregon!</a></p>
  <p>I am a <em>huge</em> fan of the Portland Trail Blazers and basketball in general. I enjoy watching any form of TV show and movies,
    some of my favorite titles are Star Wars, Marvel, Game of Thrones <strong>(before season 7)</strong>, and many others. Other things I do in my free time are
    play video games and I like to do any other sort of random activity with my friends and family, such as going to the store or on a hike. I 
    also dream of being able to vacation around the world and see all the places earth has to offer us.
  </p>

  <h2> My Background</h2>

  <p>I have a General Science degree with an emphasis in computer science, psychology, and geography, along with a minor in computer science and 
    psychology. I did most of my work in school on Python and C, along with a little C#. I decided to pursue programming because I have always had
    an interest in working in the field of computers since I was little, and working through the challenges brings me a large sence of accomplishment
    and fulfilment. In my past I have worked for:
